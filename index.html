  <h1>BAHARI BEACH</h1>
  <div class="column">
  <h2>Welcome to Bahari Beach Hotel. This Indian Ocean luxury 5 star boutique beach hotel in Kenya is everyone’s
    favorite and our guests just keep coming back for more.</h2>
  <p>An iconic tropical paradise on the Kenyan coast sitting right in the middle of the pristine Watamu Marine National
    Park with its idyllic white sand beach and turquoise waters. The exceptional personal service and sincere charm of
    this established hotel has come to represent Kenyan coastal luxury to so many travellers for close to 30 years. And
    it’s just got even better with a mega makeover.</p>
  <p>There is so much to do here – learn to kite-surf; get your PADI certificate, take a sunset dhow cruise on Mida
    Creek, play a round of golf on the nearby world class golf course, Vipingo Ridge; or go on safari for a few days in
    Tsavo or the Maasai Mara. If that all sounds a little too energetic, relax around the pool with a good book as you
    work your way through our cocktail menu.</p>

  <h3>Weather & Climate</h3> <img src="images/weatherindex.jpg" height="500" width="600">
  <p>The low-lying coast of Kenya creates a tropical climate with wonderful sea breezes. It is at its hottest in March
    but cools off in July with temperatures ranging between 26C and 32C throughout the year. The monsoons bring two
    distinct seasons – when the warm air moves south in March, the longer rains follow in April and May. It moves north
    again in September bringing the shorter rains of October and November. The southeast wind, called Kusi, blows from
    mid March to November, cooling the waters. The northeast breeze, called Kaskazi, brings warmer, calm seas throughout
    the months of December, January and February.
