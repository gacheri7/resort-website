  <h1>Welcome to Bahari Beach Hotel</h1>
  <h2>Entry Requirements</h2>
  <p>A passport (valid 6 months beyond intended stay) and a visa is required for holders of European Union passports.
    This may be obtained from the Kenya High Commission in London and or the Kenya Embassy in your country, or on
    arrival at Nairobi - Mombasa International Airports. The cost of USD 50 will be payable in cash. You must have
    tickets and/or documents for return or onward travel.

    Visitors must be in possession of a valid visa (if applicable to your nationality) together with relevant health
    documentation, upon arrival to both Kenya and Tanzania. Different regulations do apply according to nationality and
    country of origin. It is recommended that all visitors check with their nearest tourist office or diplomatic mission
    before any travel details are made. Medical centres in your country of origin will provide the necessary
    professional medical advice on all relevant health requirements.
  </p>
  <h3>Medical Advice</h3>
  <p>
    Both Kenya and Tanzania enjoy a healthy, invigorating climate and visitors need feel no concern for their general
    health during the course of their stay. By far the biggest risk is Malaria, which is endemic in certain areas.
    Anti-Malarial medication should be taken according to the advice of your local medical practitioner. Visitors
    requiring special medication should pack sufficient supplies in their hand luggage. Chemists and pharmacies are
    generally well stocked, however the names of some generic medication can differ. Consult your medical practitioner
    for advice on alternative medication to take, as some medication is not readily available. Mineral water is
    available in most camps, lodges and hotels, throughout Kenya and Tanzania. (In many, purified or filtered drinking
    water is provided free).

    Yellow Fever / Other vaccinations / Malaria: It is now generally accepted that the Cholera vaccination is
    ineffective. Vaccination against Yellow Fever is recommended, check with your Embassy and/or local health office for
    more details. Anti-malarial prophylactics should be taken in accordance with medical advice, especially if you visit
    the Coast. Good medical facilities are available in the major cities. Comprehensive travel insurance is essential,
    this can be reinforced by membership of Flying Doctors or similar Medical Evacuation organisations which can be
    arranged through us at a reasonable rate.

    We will endeavour, wherever possible to meet any special needs that our clients may have. In the case of special
    dietary requirements, most hotels, camps and lodges within the region are prepared (given sufficient notice) to
    cater for these. For persons who are disabled in any way, we will do our utmost to cater for whatever needs may
    apply. We do require advance notice of any requirements, so please ensure that we are made aware at the time of
    making a booking.
  </p>
  <h3>Currency</h3>
  <p>The local currency is the Kenya Shilling ( Ksh/-) and is freely exchangeable within this country and neighbouring
    countries but not elsewhere. Make sure that you use or exchange any local currency before departure. Most major
    establishments accept the main Credit Cards, but may charge a premium. Cash dispensers ( ATMs) and Forex Bureaux are
    infrequent outside of the main centres, make sure that you have sufficient local currency before leaving on Safari.
    Most major credit cards are accepted, however, charges are high compared to Europe.

    Currency control regulations prohibit the export of local currency. There is no restriction however, to the amount
    of foreign currency a visitor may import. Only authorised foreign exchange bureaus and banks are permitted to
    exchange foreign money. Kenya and Tanzania currencies are interchange </p>
